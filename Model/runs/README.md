# 🏃 Training Runs

This folder contains the **output directories** for each training execution.  
Each run is saved in a dedicated folder (`run1/`, `run2/`, `run3/`, ...), keeping logs, checkpoints, and other artifacts separated. 
Please note that this folder is intended to show the structure of the outputs, but right now they're just placeholders; if you want more details on the results, please look into the 📂 **Final Writings** section.

## 📂 Folder Structure

```
📁 run1/    # Output of the first training run (logs, checkpoints, results)
📁 run2/    # Output of the second training run
📁 run3/    # Output of the third training run
📄 README.md
```

## 📌 Notes

- Each folder is automatically created during training.  
- Use these folders to **store checkpoints, metrics, plots, and logs** for reproducibility.  
- The numbering (`run1`, `run2`, ...) ensures outputs remain organized across multiple experiments.
