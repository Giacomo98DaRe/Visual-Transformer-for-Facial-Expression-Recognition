## 📖 Overview

This thesis explores the use of **attention mechanisms** and **Vision Transformers (ViTs)** for **Facial Emotion Recognition (FER)** in natural settings.  
The research investigates state-of-the-art architectures (ViT, Swin, Poster V2, DINO) and proposes a **Two-Stream model** that processes landmark-based and feature-based inputs in parallel to improve recognition accuracy.

## ⚠️ Notes
  
- Experiments were originally run on **university GPU clusters** with Docker/Conda environments.  
- The repo is structured for clarity and reproducibility but not all datasets/models can be shared here due to size/licensing limits.
